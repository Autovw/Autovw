## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome on my profile!

I'm a (former) software developer from the Netherlands with experience in languages such as Java, PHP, Python, and more! \
I started programming in 2020 through the creation of my first Discord BOT, and have since gotten my degree in software development.
On the internet I'm mostly known for my Minecraft mods, which have garnered over 35 million downloads on CurseForge and Modrinth. \
Even though I no longer work in software development I still continue to work on several projects in my spare time.
